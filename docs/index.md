# Notes

These are just some of my old notes I made about random stuff that I learned. These are from 2018-2019, at that time I use to just write stuff down in markdown and push it to the repo. Now I've shifted to using obsidian and sync those note to a private repository(I push lot of secret stuff by mistake so had to make it private ðŸ˜…).
