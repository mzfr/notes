I use to play AOE2 back when I was in school but that was just me playing against AI all the time and trying to just use cheat codes to gather resources.

I never cared about the build orders, early rushes, booming/turtling. Just enjoyed spamming "rock on" cheat to get 1000 rocks and then build an infinite amount of castles :)

Recently I started playing AOE4 and really enjoyed it. Also tried playing against the opponents and got wrecked. That has encouraged me properly understand the game and improve my game.

P.S - I'm currently ranked Bronze II so please take all the Tips and Suggestions with a grain of salt.
