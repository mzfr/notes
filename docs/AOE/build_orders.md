I watch a lot of PROs play the game and also a lot of casted games by Aussie Drongo and there I just see what is the most common build order being used, then try them out in games.

So here I'll just list all of the interesting and most common build orders being used for all the civilizations.

Also, I'm only adding build orders as I try them in games and against the hardest AI. This way I can add some tips/suggestions from a beginner's perspective.
