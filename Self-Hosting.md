* Tried cloudron - Not worth it
    - I used the digitalocean marketplace to deploy it - https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/cloudron
    - The main thing is pricing, if I'm going to pay for the server then paying for the clouron sounds a bit odd. 
    - Cloudron runs everything inside a docker, which is good. But it runs too many services by default due to which the memory usage is bit high most of the time.
    - This way might be good for the people who doesn't want to do lot of technical stuff by themself and would like to just use the GUI to setup everything in few minutes.
